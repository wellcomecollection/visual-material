# Level

To identify the level of the unit of description within the collectionâ€™s hierarchical arrangement.&#x20;

Rules: &#x20;

* Select the appropriate level from the picklist.&#x20;
* Collection (fonds in ISAD(G)) represents the top level. Item (file in ISAD(G)) represents the producible unit: the thing that a researcher can order and consult, such as a file or volume. &#x20;
* Other levels are more flexible and should be used as appropriate. It is not necessary to fill every rung on the ladder: it is acceptable to jump from collection to item level.&#x20;
* If part numbering (See [Numbering and Part Numbering](broken-reference)), use item level for each unit and sub-series to unify them.&#x20;
