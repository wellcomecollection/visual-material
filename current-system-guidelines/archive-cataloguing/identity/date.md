# Date\*

To identify and record the date(s) of creation or production of the material in the unit of description. &#x20;

## Known dates

* Provide a single date or a range of dates as appropriate.&#x20;
* Specific days can be provided alongside the month and year if felt appropriate, but in general the year(s) or month and year(s) will suffice.&#x20;
* Do not use individual dates separated by commas. If, for instance, a file contains two items, one from 1930 and one from 1970, enter the date as a range, “1930-1970”, and provide an explanation in the Description field, for instance “the two letters in this file date from 1930 and 1970”.&#x20;
* Never use “undated”, “n.d.” (no date) or “u.d.”. Always provide an estimated date, even if only a century, and note “Date estimated by cataloguer” in the description field.&#x20;
* Where the date is inscribed on an object in a differing format this should be standardised for the Date field but recorded as inscribed in the Inscription field.&#x20;

| **Known date content** | Known date format |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Day, Month, Year       | 04 April 1954     |
| Month, Year            | April 1954        |
|  Year                  | 1954              |
|  Century               | 19th century      |
|  Year range            | 1860-1893         |

## Estimated dates

* When estimating dates, do so to the best of your ability. If you cannot specify down to a decade(s) then use century but do not leave the field blank or use n.d.&#x20;
* When estimating a date to the decade or century, there is no need to add dates (i.e. 20th century (1900-1999)) because CALM has a built-in functionality in user search that will infer dates. See [CALM documentation - Format for Period Fields](http://www.dswebhosting.info/documents/Manuals/ALM/V10/MANUAL/main\_menu/basics/period\_field\_format.htm) to see how CALM interprets estimated dates. Keep in mind the following when cataloguing estimated dates:&#x20;
* When using c. in date estimates, CALM will search 10 years after and 10 years before e.g. c.1960 will include the year 1950 up to 1970&#x20;
* When using a ‘s’ in a decade i.e. 1970s, this implies the years 1970-1979&#x20;

| Unknown date content | Unknown date format                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Estimated year       | c. 1962                                            |
| 2 possible dates     | 1781 or 1782                                       |
| Estimated range      | <p>c.1860-1872<br>1953-c.1960<br>c.1953-c.1969</p> |

* At higher levels where there is a specific date range for the bulk of items below with a minority more broadly estimated, put the specific date range in the date field. Add a note to the description field to state that there is also an item that may not fit within the specified date range. Add the following standard text:&#x20;

“Some items in this \[add appropriate level e.g. series] have an estimated date by the cataloguer \[insert date range e.g. 20th century] that falls outside the specified date range.”&#x20;

## Born-digital&#x20;

* For born-digital material provide a date range based on the earliest creation date (excluding 1 January 1970) and latest last modified date of the digital files within the item. If the dates are not straightforward (for instance if files were modified years after creation because they were checked by the depositor immediately prior to deposit), retain the dates but include an explanation in the description field and, if possible, an indication of a more accurate date/date range. Base the date range only on the dates of digital files and ignore folder dates.&#x20;



## Other Dates&#x20;

For guidance on how to include publication, copyright, accession, or cataloguing dates in the record see the following fields:

* Acquisition
* Copyright
* Publication\_Production
* ArchivistsNotes

### Copies

* If the object is a copy or reproduction of an original object or work, record the creation date of the object you are cataloguing. You can reference the original object or work in the Related\_Material field if it is held by Wellcome Collection.&#x20;
