# BoxNumber

To provide a number for the box or storage unit housing the physical item to aid locating material.

Rules:&#x20;

* Only use this field for Item level records. It is only needed when the record relates to an orderable item. &#x20;
* Boxes are numbered sequentially. &#x20;
* Items too large to fit in a standard box (box types A and B) are given an outsize box (box type C) number. These numbers form a separate sequence, starting at 1 again e.g. O/S 1&#x20;
* Items too large to fit in a box, e.g. some visual material, will not have a box number. Please use the location of the item in this field.&#x20;
* Items cannot exist in multiple locations. If an item is held in multiple folders, all the folders must be in the same box. If an item comprises a standard folder and an outsize folder, they should be catalogued as two items and cross-referenced in the Description field. &#x20;
* This field is not required for born-digital material. &#x20;
