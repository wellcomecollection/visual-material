# PublicRef\*

To provide a publicly visible and unique reference number that readers use to order material, and to facilitate retrievals. &#x20;

Rules: &#x20;

* The PublicRef should mirror the RefNo with the exception of an additional slash within the first two parts of the reference. &#x20;
* For levels beneath the collection, use letters for the section levels and numbers for the levels below that. The letters I and O should not be used for sections, as they are easily confused with the numbers 1 and 0.&#x20;
* Use a forward slash to indicate different levels within the hierarchy.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
PP/COO (collection); PP/COO/A (section); PP/COO/A/1 (series); PP/COO/A/1/1 (item)
{% endhint %}
