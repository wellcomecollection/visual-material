# Extent



To note the quantity and type of material being described for collections management purposes, as well as for the researcherâ€™s benefit.&#x20;

Rules:&#x20;

* At all levels, give the overall quantities and object type or types using the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus. The broadest object type term should be used in the extent field.
* For single 2D objects, print, drawing, painting, or photograph should cover most material, whereas groupings of material might be more appropriately described by their container i.e. album, sketchbook etc.&#x20;
* For 3D objects, the general form is most appropriate in the extent field i.e. sculpture rather than bust.&#x20;
* Additional more specific object types can be added to the Physical\_Description field.  &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
1 print&#x20;

3 paintings

14 drawings, 8 photographs and 9 paintings

9 albums&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* When cataloguing multiple images on a single physical item, the extent is best expressed with the container or support at item level to make retrieval clearer. Where there are multiple images on a single support but also multiple supports, both should be expressed.
* At higher levels, the overall quantities and object types are sufficient.

{% hint style="info" %}
2 drawings on 1 sheet&#x20;

1 painting in 3 panels&#x20;

4 photographs in 1 frame&#x20;

3 drawings on 1 mount

2 photographs on 1 plate, 2 photographs on 2 sheets&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* For born-digital material, use two instances of the extent field. The first should state the number of 'image files' at item level. Extent/2 should record the size of the item in both bytes and larger byte units. At parent level Extent should record the number of digital items and Extent/2 should record the total size of the items.
