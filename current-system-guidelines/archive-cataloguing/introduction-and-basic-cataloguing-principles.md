# Introduction and basic cataloguing principles

## What is covered in this manual?

This manual is intended to provide instruction on which fields should be populated when cataloguing Visual Material in CALM with detail on what information and which format it should be entered in.

Visual Material refers to all 2D, 3D and born digital objects which communicate information in a predominately visual way, but excludes any time-based media. Where there is existing guidance which should be followed, links will be given to the specific field to avoid duplicating information.&#x20;

Although the cataloguing field names within this manual are the labels used in the archive cataloguing system (CALM), this does not replace use of the local CALM user manual for system specific instructions.&#x20;

## ISAD(G)

Cataloguing at Wellcome is carried out in accordance with the basic principles set out in ISAD(G)2. In line with ISAD(G), every piece of archival description must include the following basic pieces of metadata:&#x20;

* Reference (must be unique)&#x20;
* Title, or brief description (more detailed description should be put in the description field)&#x20;
* Extent (some indication of the bulk of the material)&#x20;
* Date(s) of material&#x20;
* Level of description (namely, is this a collection-level description, a series heading, a producible item, a piece within a producible item, etc.).

The use of ISAD(G) at Wellcome for non-visual archive materials is discussed in more detail in the Archive Cataloguing Manual so we will only discuss the discuss the deviations here.

Visual material cataloguing adheres more strictly to ISAD(G) 2nd edition in mandating a creator name be added at all levels, if known. **An exception may be made for mass re-cataloguing material within existing archive structures which would cause non-visual material without creator names to be significantly obscured by the catalogue API.** &#x20;

Visual material cataloguing also expands upon departing from the inheritance principle by ensuring that information for the core fields outlined above are included at every level, with the exception of the creator and creator role which should be added at every level only if known.&#x20;

## Visual Material Metadata Framework

To make visual material cataloguing more consistent across the collection, we have created an in-house Visual Material Metadata Framework which meets the core requirements of Spectrum and is informed by the Cataloguing Cultural Objects (CCO) manual published by the Visual Resources Association (VRA).     &#x20;

In addition to the minimum ISAD(G) requirements, Spectrum requires:&#x20;

* Object Name (broad type of object)
* Current Owner
* Current Location
* Recorder and recording date

Whilst CCO doesn't have any mandatory fields, it does recommend the use of these additions for a core record:&#x20;

* Measurements display (number and size of the materials)
* Creator display (and creator role)
* Controlled Subject (subject term)

The metadata crosswalk shows how each element of the Metadata Framework can be mapped to ISAD(G), CCO, Spectrum and MARC standards.

The elements in the Visual Material Metadata Framework are referred to in square brackets throughout this cataloguing manual. &#x20;

## Level of Detail

To make cataloguing more consistent across Wellcome Collection, refer to the [Pre Cataloguing Considerations](broken-reference) section to decide whether the material would benefit from more granular cataloguing.
