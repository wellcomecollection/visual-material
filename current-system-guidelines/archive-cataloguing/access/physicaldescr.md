# PhysicalDescr

To provide information about any notable or important physical characteristics that affect the use of the material.&#x20;

Rules:&#x20;

* For visual material, this field is used to display additional object types, materials, techniques and dimensions for the material being described.&#x20;
* Terms for object types, materials and techniques should be taken from the [Getty AAT](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/).&#x20;
* Metadata should be ordered and separated with punctuation in the following way:&#x20;

additional object types; techniques and/or materials: dimension measured and measurement

{% hint style="info" %}
(Extent: 1 print.) postcard; woodburytype: sheet 15.2 x 28.5 cm

(Extent: 1 scrapbook.) postcards, posters, stickers: sheets range in size from 3.3 x 4.4 cm to 78.3 x 35.6 cm

(Extent: 4 paintings and 1 drawing.) gouache, ink drawing, watercolours: sheets range in size from 15.4 x 18.9 cm to 56.7 x 72.8 cm

(Extent: 1 album.) paintings, drawings; acrylic, pastel: album 45.2 x 40 cm&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Techniques and Materials&#x20;

* For single objects, each term should be expressed singularly. Terms can be expressed in plural where they apply to multiple objects and should be chosen to describe each object in the group. If this would result in too many different techniques or material terms, choose the most prominent and/or broadest terms.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
stipple engraving

gouaches, acrylic paintings
{% endhint %}

* Natural language may be used to express the relationships between techniques and materials or imply where one technique is more prominent than another. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
stipple engraving with etching on paper

gouache on wood, acrylic painting with pencil drawing on paper
{% endhint %}

* There is also no need to repeat object types when they would also be included in the technique term.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
(Extent: 1 drawing.) ink on paper&#x20;

rather than&#x20;

(Extent: 1 drawing.) ink drawing on paper&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* The only exception to this is where colour is intrinsic to the technique term.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
(Extent: 1 lithograph.) chromolithograph
{% endhint %}

* If hand-coloured or otherwise a notable characteristic of the object, further information may be added in the Description field.&#x20;
* If there is uncertainty on the specific technique or medium, use the broadest applicable known term.

### Dimensions

* Record dimensions in cm, and round to 1 decimal place. Orientation is suggested by recording height x width x depth.&#x20;
* _Specify what is being measured using the following standard terms:_

{% hint style="info" %}
* _sheet_&#x20;
* _plate mark_
* _mount_&#x20;
* _frame_&#x20;
* _box_
* _album_
* _sketchbook_
* _scrapbook_
* _print_
* _plate_
* _negative_&#x20;
* _canvas_
* _panel_
* _folded_&#x20;
* _rolled_
* _object \[3D objects only]_
{% endhint %}

* At minimum, record the largest dimensions for a single object, or a range of the smallest and largest dimensions for a group of objects. If the object is irregularly shaped record the greatest dimensions.

{% hint style="info" %}
sheet 30 x 40 cm

frames range in size from 24 x 52 cm to 34 x 60 cm
{% endhint %}

* If the group is relatively homogeneous, it may be useful to still specify other specific elements of the object being recorded in a range.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
album 30.5 x 55.7 cm, photographs range in size from 8.4 x 11.7 cm to 12.9 x 13.5 cm
{% endhint %}

* Enhanced records may also include measurements of more specific elements such as plate mark.

{% hint style="info" %}
plate mark 20.5 x 30.5 cm, sheet 30 x 40 cm
{% endhint %}

If the shape is unusual or a distinguishing characteristic, you may want to record an indication of the outline form.

{% hint style="info" %}
frame 45 x 20.5 cm (oval)
{% endhint %}

If the object contains multiple distinct images, it may be helpful to record an indication of the section.

{% hint style="info" %}
overall 183 x 187 cm, central panel 183 x 105 cm, each side panel 183 x 39 cm
{% endhint %}

### &#x20;Born Digital&#x20;

For born-digital material **instead** record details of the original media, including basic operating system requirements where known and hardware and software requirements.
