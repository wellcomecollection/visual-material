# Sensitivity\_Description\*

To explain the reasoning behind an open with advisory, restricted or closed access status at the point of cataloguing. It is also used to document sensitivity reassessments.&#x20;

Rules:&#x20;

* When undertaking a sensitivity review use the following format:&#x20;

Not sensitive/Sensitive. Reason: \[free text following guidance below]

{% hint style="info" %}
Reassessed as part of annual January openings&#x20;

Reassessed by Access Advisory Panel&#x20;

Reassessed as part of a targeted collection/series/item re-review.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* Be specific and provide enough information to allow other members of the team to understand the original logic for the decision made.&#x20;
* Do not use personal names in the explanation. If necessary, use initials.&#x20;
* You are not required to add “Not sensitive” to records deemed Open at the point of cataloguing. This should only be done if a record looks like it might be sensitive and it is appropriate to clarify why it is open. &#x20;
* For born-digital records, include details of any large batches of files that could not be sensitivity reviewed due to being inaccessible (i.e. lacking correct software)&#x20;
* When undertaking a sensitivity review as part of digitisation use the standard phrases set out in the Assessment tracking document AND include the phrase ‘Reassessed as part of a targeted collection re-review’.&#x20;
