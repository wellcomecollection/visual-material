# Creator\_Name

To record the authorised standard name of the creator(s) of the material: whether an individual or an organisation.

Rules:

* Use this field at all levels.
* Only one creator name per field. Repeat the field as required for each creator.
* If the creator is unknown this field can be left blank.
* Search the [**Library of Congress authorities**](https://authorities.loc.gov) **(LC)** and [**Getty Union List of Artists Names**](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/) **(ULAN)** (which feed into Sierra). If the individual or body exist as creators here, copy the name in the form given here (to ensure cross-searchability).
* If the name is not there, search the Sierra database for a local version of the name. The entry should be in line with Wellcome's standard order and punctuation.&#x20;



* For individuals, list "Surname, First name(s), Title, DOB-DOD".

* When an individual is recognised by a single name, prefer the known name over Surname, First name structure.&#x20;
* An initial may be used if the first name is unknown.&#x20;
* If the individual has a longer name, including middle names, they are not commonly known by, this may be included after the first name in brackets.&#x20;
* For organisations, use the most recent available name stated within the material, or in supporting documentation, capitalised in natural order followed by dates of operation. Where the organisation is still extant or the individual is still alive, the DOB,DOD and operating dates may be omitted.    &#x20;

* If no name exists in Sierra, check the Calm name authority database. If an authority record exists, paste the authorised name into the Creator\_Name field and edit to bring punctuation into line with above Wellcome standard.&#x20;
* If no name authority exists for the required individual or organisation, create one and copy the authorised name form into the Creator\_Name field of the item being catalogued, before bringing punctuation into line as stated above. For organisations, take the name as it is written on the object or accompanying documentation.&#x20;
* Where there is more than one version of the name in use prefer the version found in the LC or ULAN authority lists, or the version in Sierra if not in LC or ULAN. Overwrite the version in the CALM authority database if a preferred version exists elsewhere, or it isn't in line with the current Wellcome standard.
* If multiple entities were involved in creating the object or group of objects, record all of them in the manner above. If they are too numerous, record the most important or most prominent. This includes both individuals and organisations involved in the commission, production, copying, alteration, publication and/or ownership.
* If attribution is uncertain or contested, linked with or after another creator, clarify the attribution in the [Description](../content/description.md) field.
