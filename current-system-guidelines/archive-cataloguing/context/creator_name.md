# Creator\_Name

To record the authorised standard name of the creator(s) of the material: whether an individual or an organisation.&#x20;

Rules:&#x20;

* Use this field at all levels.
* Only one creator name per field. Repeat the field as required for each creator.  &#x20;
* If the creator is unknown this field can be left blank.&#x20;
* Search the  [**Library of Congress authorities**](https://authorities.loc.gov) **(LC)** and [**Getty Union List of Artists Names**](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/) **(ULAN)** (which feed into Sierra). If the individual or body exist as creators here, copy the name in the form given here (to ensure cross-searchability).&#x20;
* If the name is not there, search the Calm name authority database. If an authority record exists, paste the authorised name into the Creator\_Name field and edit to bring punctuation into line with Wellcome’s standard for this field: we do not use brackets for dates (e.g. “Watson, Thomas, 1850-1927.”). When an artist is recognised by a single name, prefer the known name over Surname, First name structure.

* If no name authority exists for the required individual, create one and copy the authorised name form into the Creator\_Name field of the item being catalogued, before bringing punctuation into line as stated above. For organisations, take the name as it is written on the object or accompanying documentation. Where there is more than one version of the name in use prefer the version found in the LC or ULAN authority lists.
* If multiple entities were involved in creating the object or group of objects, record all of them in the manner above. If they are too numerous, record the most important or most prominent. This includes both individuals and organisations involved in the commission, production, copying, alteration and/or publication.
* If attribution is uncertain or contested, linked with or after another creator, clarify the attribution in the [Description](../content/description.md) field.&#x20;
