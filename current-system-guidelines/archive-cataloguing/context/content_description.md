A White woman is depicted in a white dress and bonnet and seated in a wooden chair upholstered in red fabric. The background includes a blue wall with a window, picture frame and small table in view, and a brown carpet with a red flower pattern. Several black and brown figures pull on a rope wound around her stomach and another points an arrow into her arm. Her facial expression and body position appear to show pain.

The work is titled 'The cholic', and so it likely represents the muscular contractions and discomfort associated with Colic pain. (Cataloguer's Interpretation)
