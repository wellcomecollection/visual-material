# Description

Rules:&#x20;

* Use paragraph tags \<p> \</p> to break up large amounts of text.&#x20;
* Any elements can be clarified in the description field but the following are the most relevant to visual material cataloguing:

### Title&#x20;

* If an inscribed title taken from the object has notable features, such as being written in mirror writing, or is incorporated into the visual design, this information can be added to the description.&#x20;

### Date

* If there is an item that may not fit within the specified date range. Add the following standard text:&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Some items in this \[add appropriate level e.g. series] have an estimated date by the cataloguer \[insert date range e.g. 20th century] that falls outside the specified date range.
{% endhint %}

* The description field can also be used to clarify an uncertain date or estimated date with further information&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}

## Detailed Visual Description

Description can also include a more detailed description of the content of the image or object where they would benefit from enhanced description due to their complexity, to enhance access for visually impaired audiences, or to include more detailed interpretation of the object not present elsewhere in the record. This is best used when describing single objects.

Record the subject of the image with a brief description of how and where they are situated including surrounding details and colours.&#x20;

Jeffrey Hudson is depicted stood in front of a pulled curtain and balustrade and next to a small, low table, possibly a background set. He is looking at the viewer, holding his left hand to his waist and holding an unidentified object in his right hand. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

If they are visibly showing symptoms of a medical condition **that is relevant to understanding the visual image**, record the area of the body, followed by a brief description.

{% hint style="info" %}

The hand is depicted as White with two smallpox pustules on the wrist, one pustule on the index finger and a larger darker pustule on the back of the hand. The background is dark brown at the top and dark blue at the bottom.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Record if any part of the visual image represents a subject or idea that is non-abstract. Include the source of the interpretation including collaborators and cataloguers.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
[10743i](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/h7k5949x)

A White woman is depicted in a white dress and bonnet and seated in a wooden chair upholstered in red fabric. The background includes a blue wall with a window, picture frame and small table in view, and a brown carpet with a red flower pattern. Several black and brown figures pull on a rope wound around her stomach and another points an arrow into her arm. Her facial expression and body position appear to show pain.

The work is titled 'The cholic', and so it likely represents the muscular contractions and discomfort associated with Colic pain. (Cataloguer's Interpretation)
