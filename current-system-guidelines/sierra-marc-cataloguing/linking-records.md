# Enquiries Amendments Quick Reference

Before acting on a catalogue amendment, sense check the request. In the majority of cases the enquirer will name a source for their information. This maybe academic research, a published source, another collections catalogue, family history or archival material. If you need clarification, ask the enquirer.

If you want more information, other institutions are a great source to cross check information for prints and published material, or anything that has the potential to be duplicated and in the public realm - such as photographs created by commercial photographers.

A good starting point for many of our prints is the [**British Museum**](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection) catalogue. In addition, comparable items will be held in many different collections – think about the subject content and where an item is likely to be held, then search the relevant institutional catalogue. Searching Google can uncover sources you hadn’t considered.

It is also possible we have more than one copy of a print, search the [**Wellcome**](https://wellcomecollection.org/collections) catalogue to check for additional records. These may provide useful information but, be aware there may be different versions of the same print. Don’t add information that is not relevant to the print you are cataloguing.

It is often helpful to consult the original, even if a digital version is available. When looking at originals, the i number should be written on the item in pencil. Always check this, as we may hold multiple copies of something, and it is important to consult the correct copy.
