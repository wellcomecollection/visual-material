Wellcome aims to comply with BSR in MARC records. To mark a Visual record as BSR compliant use the following fields:\
\
**|b**eng                = language of cataloguing\
**|e**rda                 = a record applying RDA\
**|e**dcrmg            = a record applying DCRM(G)

The Wellcome Metadata Framework is based on CCO guidelines. To show the record takes this approach add:

**|e**cco                 = a record applying CCO

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;**040 \_\_** UkLW**|b**eng**|e**rda**|e**dcrmg**|e**cco
{% endhint %}
