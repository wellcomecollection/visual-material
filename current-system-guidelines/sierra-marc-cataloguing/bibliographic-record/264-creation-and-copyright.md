# 264 Date & Place of Creation

264 relates to the production, publication, distribution and manufacture (i.e. the creation) of an object. It is also used for the copyright date.

Metadata in 264 should inform data entered into the relevant subfields in the [Fixed Fields](leader-fields.md).

Use the correct second indicator, this relates to the type of information being recorded:

**264 \_0** Production\
**264 \_1** Publication\
**264 \_2** Distribution\
**264 \_3** Manufacture\
**264 \_4** Copyright date

The field is repeatable if multiple types of information are available, i.e. production and publication

If the information is taken from a source other than the object itself, place the information in a square bracket.

Add a 500 or 510 note where information is taken from an outside source if considered significant.
