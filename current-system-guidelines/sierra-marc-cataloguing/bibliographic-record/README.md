# Bibliographic Record

The Bibliographic record contains the descriptive information about an object. This includes all the metadata elements covered in the Wellcome Visual Metadata Framework, except location. Information relating to condition and provenance may be found in both the Bibliographic and Item records due to legacy data. These guidelines will indicate where information on condition and provenance should be located for new records.
