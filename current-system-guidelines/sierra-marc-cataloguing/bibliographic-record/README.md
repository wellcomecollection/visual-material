# Bibliographic Record

The Bibliographic record contains the descriptive information about an object. This includes all the metadata elements covered in the Wellcome Visual Metadata Framework, except location. Information relating to condition and provenance may be found in both the Bibliographic and Item records due to legacy data. These guidelines will indicate where information on condition and provenance should be located for new records.

Visual material records in Sierra should reflect the use of MARC across the whole Wellcome catalogue. With fields where content and use is standard across Wellcome, regardless of format, the guidelines will link to common shared instructions to ensure consistency in the catalogue.

Visual records should aim to meet Spectrum standards for Museum Accreditation. The ideal record should contain the following core fields in the Bibliographic record:
