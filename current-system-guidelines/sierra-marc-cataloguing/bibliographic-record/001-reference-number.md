# 001 Reference Number

This is the unique Wellcome Collection identification number for the object being catalogued.

It is created from the Sierra system number (b number) of the catalogue record: drop the b and replace the last number with an i.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
b30496639 would become **3049663i**
{% endhint %}

This should be entered directly into the 001 Ref No field

{% hint style="info" %}
**001 \_\_** 3049663i
{% endhint %}

The Reference Number (also referred to as i number) is should also be added to **524** and the **Shelfmark** in the Item record.&#x20;
