# Online/digital images with static Miro metadata

You will often find online images that were previously part of Wellcome Images and the metadata associated with them cannot be edited. The image may also be orphaned from the catalogue record if we own the physical item.

An example of an image like this will have the tag “digital images”:

<img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt="" data-size="original">

## Finding a reference/more information

Although in most cases we can’t edit the image or the data, it might be possible to find out more information about the image using the reference number.

If you have the [API toolbar turned on](https://dash.wellcomecollection.org/toggles/), you can reveal the image reference number (and often some other metadata that might be hidden).

If you don’t have access to the API toolbar, you can download the image and find the reference number in the browser address bar:\
![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

If the reference has a M prefix, search **CALM** for the re-catalogued entry if it hasn’t filtered through to the front end yet. Use "Any text field" and paste the image reference number, i.e. M0001851

If any other prefix, try searching for it in [Tandem Vault](https://wellcome.tandemvault.com/). Occasionally, there’ll be a bibliographic number listed.

We're assuming that the reference number doesn't exist in Sierra, but if you want to check select **o REFERENCE NO** and format the image number like: M 1851. You'll need to remove the leading zeros and add a space.
