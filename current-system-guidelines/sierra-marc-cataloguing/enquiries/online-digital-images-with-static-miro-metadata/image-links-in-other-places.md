# Image links in other places

The M series images that were re-catalogued as the glass plate negative series are now attached to their respective CALM record.

If the image is from a physical item in our collection, this link exists in the “Related materials” field in CALM with text like:

“Wellcome Collection holds several versions of the work. This image comes from [EPB/D/2731/1](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/dweu2ycs)”

In the reciprocal Sierra record for the physical item the image has been taken from, a link back to the CALM record exists in the 787 MARC field (“Other relationship” or as tagged on WC.org as “Related material”) with text like:

“Select images of this work were taken by the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum: [WT/D/1/20/1/3/2](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/c9qderky)”

The image visible in the CALM record has been re-ingested through Goobi, so no longer has the old M series reference number in the image metadata. The image visible in the Sierra record has the Miro/old metadata still attached. This means that the image can technically exist in two places without any merging errors.

See `544` \[link] field use for creating links between related archival material in Sierra elsewhere.
