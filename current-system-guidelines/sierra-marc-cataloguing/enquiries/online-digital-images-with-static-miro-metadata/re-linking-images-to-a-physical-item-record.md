# Re-linking images to a physical item record

If you know that an orphaned belongs to a physical item in our collection and needs re-linking:

* Check Sierra to see if the image reference already exists in a record, and search for the image reference (**o REFERENCE NO**). Note: this will only search the `089` and not the `962`
* If your search returns no results “Your entry M 16060 would be here”, then search for the bibliographic record/bib number for the physical item you’d like to link the image to (**. SYSTEM NO**)
* Open the bib record and click edit
* Click Insert and select **i ISBN/ISSN** from the drop-down menu
* Replace the `020` with `08900` (both indicators are zero) and add the image reference number in the same format as you would search, i.e.&#x20;

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png>)

* Save and close the record

The `089` is a repeatable field, so you can add multiple image references if you have an L or a V prefixed references as well as an M.
