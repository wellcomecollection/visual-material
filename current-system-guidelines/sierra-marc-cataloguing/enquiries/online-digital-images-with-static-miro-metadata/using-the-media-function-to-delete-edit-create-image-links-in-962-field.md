# Using the media function to delete (/edit/create) image links in 962 field

Images linked in the `962` MARC field are managed outside of the bibliographic record, so when you click edit the field will be greyed out. If you have Sierra permissions you can edit these fields in the Media Manager function:

* Open the catalogue record, click edit
* On the top file menu bar go to Go > Media(2)
* Navigate the Media Manager files on the left hand side – it’s not obvious while file/URL relates to which image without opening them
* When you’ve located the incorrect image link, right click on the file that says “-000 (1 URL) and click Remove
* Save (top left) > close

You can check the field has been deleted by viewing the bibliographic record again and checking for `962` fields.
