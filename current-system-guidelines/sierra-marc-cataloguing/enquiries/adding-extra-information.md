# Adding extra information

### General notes

Use **500** to add general notes on the object. This field is free text and can be repeated. Repeating the field rather than putting all the information into a single paragraph helps readability in the public catalogue.

### Biographical information

Use **545** for information relating to the person named in the 100 field. This is only necessary for objects by artists that aren't well known, it is not necessary for well known names. The field is free text.

### Provenance information

Use field **561** to add information on provenance. The first indicator should be 1 if the information is public, or 2 if the information is to be kept inhouse. The second indicator should be blank.

### References Note

Use **510** to cite information or publications that have informed the catalogue record, or are about the object being catalogued. Use a separate 510 for each source.&#x20;

Use **510 3\_** for references where specific vols/pages arenâ€™t specified:

{% hint style="info" %}
**510 3\_** Spence, J. (1986) Putting myself in the picture.
{% endhint %}

Use **510 4\_** for references where specific vols/pages are specified:

{% hint style="info" %}
**510 4\_** The Literary Gazette,**|c**1477, May 10 1845, page 300.
{% endhint %}
