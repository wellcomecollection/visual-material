# Finding records in Sierra

### Searching Sierra

Sierra data can be searched numerous ways. Options are in the drop down menu (top left of screen).&#x20;

The quickest options are:

* **Reference No.** (Ref No) – searches for
  * **i number** (Iconographic number, unique identifier) Note the i is at the end of the number
* **System No.** – can search for:
  * **b number** – relates to the bibliographic record
  * **item number** – relates to the item record and has the i at the beginning

If the system can’t find the i number via Reference No., try the **Word** search option.

Clicking on the **+** to the right of the search box will offer advanced search options.

### **How do you identify the b number or i number?**

Both the **b** & **i number** can be found in the public catalogue by turning on the **API toolbar** in your browser [here](https://dash.wellcomecollection.org/toggles/). When this is turned on, records you view in the catalogue should display the API toolbar at the top of the page. This will show the Sierra system number (b number) and Iconographic number (unique identifier, i number) when you view a record.
