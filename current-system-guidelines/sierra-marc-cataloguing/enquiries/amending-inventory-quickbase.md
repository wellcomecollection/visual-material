# Amending Inventory Quickbase

If the object record you are amending has been inventoried, the Inventory Visual QB database needs to be updated.&#x20;

* Log into [Quickbase](https://wellcome.quickbase.com/db/main?a=SignIn&\_c=vtbdtj) - login details with KM
* Select the **Artworks** tab&#x20;
* Search on the **i number** to see if the item has been inventoried. &#x20;
* If there is an entry for it, click on the edit tool (pencil, far left column)&#x20;
* Edit the Title/Brief description field with the new title. If any other fields have been edited in the record that are covered by Inventory, ensure that data is also amended in Quickbase.&#x20;
* Under Cataloguing Info add: \
  \- Metadata Work Comments – add ‘title amended on \[DATE of amendment]’&#x20;
* Save&#x20;

If you are unable to login to QB, send details of the changes you have made (including the i number) to the Inventory team **inventory@wellcome.org**&#x20;
