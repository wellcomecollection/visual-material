# Amending Inventory Quickbase

If the object record you are amending has been inventoried, the Inventory Visual QB database needs to be updated.&#x20;

* Log into [Quickbase](https://wellcome.quickbase.com/db/main?a=SignIn&\_c=vtbdtj) - login details with KM
* Select the **Visual Materials Inventory** QB
* Select the **Artworks** tab&#x20;
* Turn off the New style option (slide button at the top of the screen, below the tabs)
* Search on the **i number** to see if the item has been inventoried, or the **Inventory number** if you have it.&#x20;
* If there is an entry, select **Grid Edit** (pencil icon at top of screen, below the tabs)&#x20;

### Existing Sierra records that have i numbers & item records

* Edit the Title/Brief description field with the new title. If any other fields have been edited in the record that are covered by Inventory, ensure that data is also amended in Quickbase.&#x20;
* Under **Cataloguing Info / Metadata Work Comments** (top right of Cataloguing Info section) add: ‘title amended on \[DATE of amendment]’&#x20;
* Save&#x20;

### Uncatalogued objects

* Add the i number under **Iconographic number**
* Keep the Inventory number in the record
* Under **Part Numbered**, from the drop down menu select **Phase 2 - item records created**
* &#x20;Edit the **Title/s or Brief Description (245)** entry to reflect the title on Sierra
* Under **Item/s on Catalogue?**, select **yes**
* Under **Metadata comments** add **Catalogued** + **initials of cataloguer** + **date catalogued**
* Add any other notes under **Additional notes / queries**
* Save&#x20;

If you are unable to login to QB, send details of the changes you have made (including the i number) to the Inventory team **inventory@wellcome.org**&#x20;
