# Sierra Tips

### **Changing titles regularly?**

Add the text of the amended title 246 1\_ field to your Macros in Sierra:

* In the top menu bar select **Admin>Settings**
* Select the **Macros** tab
* Select a free/empty f key and paste in the following:

&#x20;      t2461 |iPrevious title, replaced August 2022:|a.|5UkLW

Remember / make a note of the function key you allocated, then in future when amending records an empty field can be populated with the skeleton info required for the 246 1\_ field. Youâ€™ll just need to:

* add a new field to the record
* populate it with the 246 data but pressing the allocated function key
* amend the date
* paste in the old title

### Need to see live catalogue records as you edit?

Edits take time to appear in Works, but appear instantly in the basic Sierra [catalogue](https://catalogue.wellcomelibrary.org/).

When in the Sierra record:

* from the **menu** option (top left of the record) select **View > Public Display**
* the Sierra catalogue view will open.

### Want to see the MARC format without opening Sierra?

From the **Sierra catalogue view** (see above) you can view the MARC content. From the options on the right of the catalogue record, select **view MARC**
