# Creator / Name edits

Full details of MARC name entries are on page 7 of the [**Visual Cataloguing Instructions**](https://wellcomecloud.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/wc2/cr/ci/Cataloging/Visual%20%26%20material%20culture/Visual%20%26%20material%20culture%20cataloguing%20guidelines%20\(version%20history\)/VisualMaterialCataloguing\_v2.0\_Draft2022.docx?d=wd0ff0e2b76654dfc9b908f343c67cbfd\&csf=1\&web=1\&e=SWELtE).&#x20;

### Adding names to Catalogue records

Names are recorded in the **100/110** &/or the **700/710** fields.&#x20;

All names are added in the format:

{% hint style="info" %}
_Surname, First name(s)_,**|d**_dates of existence/activity_,**|e**_relator term_
{% endhint %}

Check the **Wellcome catalogue** and the [**LC name authority files**](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html) for existing entries, to ensure consistency.

**Relator terms** add context to a record, they are added in **subfield e**, a list of terms is [**here**](https://docs.wellcomecollection.org/visual-material/metadata-framework/metadata-elements/creator/relator-terms).

#### 100/110 Main creator name

This field is not repeatable, there can only be a single 100/110 field.

#### 700/710 Additional creator names & associated names

This field is repeatable, include all known associated names.&#x20;

To help identify if a name should go in 100 or 700, consult **Identifying Main & Added Entry points**, page 6 of **** the [**Visual Cataloguing Instructions**](https://wellcomecloud.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/wc2/cr/ci/Cataloging/Visual%20%26%20material%20culture/Visual%20%26%20material%20culture%20cataloguing%20guidelines%20\(version%20history\)/VisualMaterialCataloguing\_v2.0\_Draft2022.docx?d=wd0ff0e2b76654dfc9b908f343c67cbfd\&csf=1\&web=1\&e=SWELtE).&#x20;

### Changing names in Catalogue records

If the name attributed to the creation of an object is changed:

* Confirm the change is correct - does the enquirer reference a valid source?
* Check the Library of Congress authority file. Are we using the correct one? Is the authority file incorrect? If the later, ask a librarian to propose an edit to LoC
* Add the new name to the catalogue records:
  * In **100** if they are the main creator
  * In **700** if they are an additional creator, or a name associated with the object
* Remove any incorrect name entries
* Make the change clear by adding an explanatory note
* Acknowledge sources of information by adding a reference note in a 510 field.
