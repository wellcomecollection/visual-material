# Creator / Name edits

### Adding names to Catalogue records

Names are recorded in the **100/110** &/or the **700/710** fields.&#x20;

All names are added in the format:

{% hint style="info" %}
_Surname, First name(s)_,**|d**_dates of existence/activity_,**|e**_relator term_
{% endhint %}

Check the **Wellcome catalogue** and the [**LC name authority files**](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html) for existing entries to copy, to ensure consistency.

**Relator terms** add context to a record, they are added in **subfield e**, a list of terms is here.

#### 100/110 Main creator name

This field is not repeatable, there can only be a single 100/110 field.

#### 700/710 Additional creator names & associated names

This field is repeatable, include all known associated names.&#x20;

To help identify if a name should go in 100 or 700, consult **Identifying Main & Added Entry points**, page 6 of **** the [**Visual Cataloguing Instructions**](https://wellcomecloud.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/wc2/cr/ci/Cataloging/Visual%20%26%20material%20culture/Visual%20%26%20material%20culture%20cataloguing%20guidelines%20\(version%20history\)/VisualMaterialCataloguing\_v2.0\_Draft2022.docx?d=wd0ff0e2b76654dfc9b908f343c67cbfd\&csf=1\&web=1\&e=SWELtE).&#x20;
