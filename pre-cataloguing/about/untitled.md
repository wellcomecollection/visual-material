# Identifying prints

## General Tips

### Relief vs Intaglio&#x20;

* Look at the image. Compared with intaglio processes, relief printing allows for much larger areas of black space.&#x20;
* Look for a plate-mark. If there isn't one, its more likely to be a relief print than an intaglio. However, plate-marks can be added artificially or cut off.

### Specific Techniques

The following questions are based on those in 'How to identify Prints...' by Bamber Gascoigne, and whilst far from exhaustive, should help indicate possible print techniques for further investigation:

### Other Indicators&#x20;

* Look for a date. Some more recent techniques may be ruled out or made more likely due to their relative popularity.  &#x20;
* Look at other print collections. Many prints that are in the Wellcome Collection have been found to also be represented in the British Museums Prints and Drawings Collections, some of whose prints have lettering, where items in our collection do not.
