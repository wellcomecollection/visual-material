# Content Considerations

## Sources of Information

The main source of data for the catalogue record should be taken from:

* the object itself & it's housing
* information provided by the creator
* acquisition documentation
* Wellcome Collections files / Research files
* Wellcome Inventory database
* Transcribe Wellcome
* Related materials in the Collection
* Wellcome Conservation & Exhibitions data

If further information is available, then this should be included in the record and the source acknowledged where appropriate.

## Sensitivity

Consider the context in which the item was produced, and any personal data to be included in the record - was the item produced in a context that would warrant sensitivity considerations, such as a therapy session? Consult [Access to personal data within our research collections](http://wellcomelibrary.org/content/documents/policy-documents/access-to-personal-data.pdf) to identify material that should be considered for restricted access or personal data that should not be made public.

## Language

Metadata created for the Collections must apply the principles outlined in the Collection Information Policy: diverse and inclusive, and consistent and coherent in the language used.

When including any information as free text i.e. not controlled terminology, think about the language being used and how the information is framed. The following offer some guidance:

[APA bias-free language guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language)\
[Words Matter](https://www.tropenmuseum.nl/en/about-tropenmuseum/words-matter-publication) - a glossary which contextualises historical terms commonly used in museum collections.
