# Numbering & Part Numbering

## What is being catalogued: single or multiple records?

Establish what you are creating a record for. Is it a single object or a group of objects? This will influence the information included in the record(s) and how it is recorded.

This decision will also determine the allocation of unique ID numbers, and whether a part number is required.

### Single object

When cataloguing a single object consider if the object is a unique item, such as a painting, or one created as a multiple edition, such prints and posters. For objects created in a multiple edition, where identical copies may exist, check the Wellcome Library catalogue for an existing record.&#x20;

* A single object should be given a unique ID number, e.g. 39222i\

* Identical copies of an object should be given part numbers, e.g. 39222i.1, 39222i.2 \
  The copies must be identical impressions. Prints must be printed from the same unaltered plate, with no differences in the inscription. These are considered to be the same state. If there are differences the copies must be treated as individual items and given a unique ID number.&#x20;

### **Multiple images on a single support**

In each instance ensure there is only **one** item record that can be ordered for a single sheet.

* Two or more images printed from the same plate (with a single platemark) = 1 object, allocate a single ID number. Describe both images in the same record.\

* Two or more images printed from different plates (more than one platemark) = 2 or more objects, allocate a unique ID to each image. Each image will have it's own record. Ensure the relationship between the images/records is clear in the catalogue. \

* Two or more images pasted onto or sharing a single sheet = 1 object, with 1 ID number. In the record briefly describe the images (using cataloguers discretion to decide required specificity) and ensure the nature and relationship of the images is clear in the record.  \

*   Two or more images on both sides of a single sheet. \


    * The preferred option is to catalogue as 1 object, describe both images in one record, ensuring the description clearly states the relationship of the images. Allocate a single ID number.\

    * For unique images (drawings, paintings) where it is felt the objects warrant their own record and description, catalogue as 2 or more objects. Ensure the relationship between the images/records is clear in the catalogue. Allocate an ID number with part numbers.&#x20;



    * Where the images are part of a series, catalogue as separate objects and allocate an ID with a part number.


* Two or more images sharing a single mount or frame. In this situation consider how and when the images were framed or mounted together.\

  * Mounted or framed by the artist or as part of an original collection. Retain the grouping, and:\

    * The preferred option is to catalogue as 1 object. Describe all the images in one record, ensuring the description clearly states the relationship of the images. Allocate a single ID number.\

    * Where it is felt the images/objects warrant their own record and description, catalogue as 2 or more objects. Ensure the relationship between the images/records is clear in the catalogue. Allocate an ID number with part numbers.\
      __
  * Where the mount or framing has occurred subsequently, and is not intrinsic to the original object or collection, treat as a Group of Objects (see below). The objects could be separated in the future for exhibition purposes, the catalogue record(s) must account for this potential occurrence.

### Groups of Objects

When considering a group of objects the cataloguer can choose a high level or granular approach to cataloguing. A high level approach will describe all the objects in a single record. To add granularity to this approach a hierarchy of records can be added below the collection level description.&#x20;

For each group of objects consider:

* user need and whether the collection has been prioritised for cataloguing
* access requirements
* digitisation requirements
* available resources and knowledge
* how were the objects found, were they already in a group?
* were the objects intended as a series by the creator?

**Minimum level of cataloguing for a group of objects**\
A single record to describe the whole group of objects. This would be allocated a single ID number.&#x20;

## **Part numbers**

Part numbers are used in the following situations:

* for identical objects
* for objects given their own catalogue record, but sharing a sheet
* for objects given their own catalogue record, but sharing a mount or frame
* where the object is part of an already catalogued item
* for objects that were conceived as a set, the cataloguer can choose to use part numbers
