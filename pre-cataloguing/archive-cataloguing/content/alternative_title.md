# Alternative\_Title\*

To record parallel titles and other titles a work is known by, aside from the title proper, such as working titles, translated titles or titles it has been previously known by. State the nature of the title before a colon.&#x20;

Rules:

* For born-digital material, record the original title here if it has been altered for the title field. Prefix it with “Original title:”

**Previous Titles**&#x20;

If a new title needs to be given where an existing descriptive title is incorrect, insufficient or offensive, retain the existing title as an alternative title in the the following layout:

Previous title, replaced DATE (Month Year): Text of previous title
