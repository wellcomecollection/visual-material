# Appraisal\*

To record information on any appraisal, destruction and scheduling action taken.&#x20;

Rules: &#x20;

* Where appropriate, record the authority by which the action has been taken. &#x20;
* Use paragraph tags \<p> to break up large amounts of text. &#x20;
* For born-digital material, the collection level record should include the following: “Digital material has been transferred from the original physical media to secure storage. The physical media has not been retained.” &#x20;
* For born-digital material at lower levels, this field should record general appraisal information but do not list individual filenames; these are recorded in the DROID export. As a minimum include the first statement below in the example box. This information can be recorded at the most appropriate level.&#x20;
