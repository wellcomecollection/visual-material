# Title

To name or briefly describe the unit of description. &#x20;

Rules:&#x20;

**Given and Inscribed Titles**

* Where an object or group of objects has a Given title assigned by the creator or another authoritative source, enter this as the title. When a creator assigns Untitled as the title of an object, this should be used.
* Where an object has an Inscribed title (words interpreted as a title written or printed on the object) and no Given title, enter this as the title. If an inscribed title taken from the object has notable features, such as being written in mirror writing, or is incorporated into the visual design, this information can be added to the description field. For born-digital material, if the inscribed title on the original media or the digital file does not reflect the material, devise a title and record the original title in the Alternative\_Title field. Do not include file extensions within the title.&#x20;
* If a Given or Inscribed title is entered, record the title in it's original language, and original script if supported. If a translation and/or a transliteration are also present, include these in the Alternative\_Title field.&#x20;
* If a Given or Inscribed title is entered, ensure a brief description of the object or group of objects is also included in the record.&#x20;
*   All other titles the object or group of objects are known by should be included in the

    Alternative\_Title field.

**Descriptive Title**

* Where an object or group of objects does not have a Given or Inscribed title, the cataloguer should devise a brief description to use as a descriptive title. A descriptive title should aim to be concise making clear to the reader what the object or group of objects is and/or its subject. Avoid interpretations, or inferring emotions, themes or allegories in the title. Look for literal representations. If there are no literal representations look for shapes and colour.

Include, as appropriate, the following types of information:

* the subject type or form of material, e.g., view(s), portrait(s), sketch(es), sculpture(s)
* an identification of the main subject(s) depicted (i.e., names of persons, events, activities, and objects)
* geographical location(s) depicted, if known and significant
* the date of what is being depicted if different from the date of publication or execution
