# OrderingCodes\*

To instruct the library system (Sierra) for online ordering. The chosen option will determine the location code an item receives to aid retrievals.&#x20;

Rules: &#x20;

* Only use this field for Item level records. It is only needed when the record relates to an orderable item. &#x20;
* Complete this field after completing access status field. &#x20;
* Select the appropriate option from the picklist. This will be determined by whether an item is open or closed, and the format of the material, particularly if it requires a separate storage location.&#x20;
* There is not a separate option for born-digital or visual material catalogued as archives. Use either “Archives - Requestable” (for items that are open or restricted) or “Archives - Not Requestable” (for items that have any other access status) from the picklist.&#x20;
