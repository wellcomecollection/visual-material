# RefNo\*

To provide a unique reference for internal use to stack the data in a tree structure. The collection reference is assigned at the point of acquisition and so will have already been assigned at the point of cataloguing. &#x20;

Rules: &#x20;

* The RefNo should duplicate the PublicRef, with the exception of the first slash, which should be omitted. This ensures the collection level record will be at the top of the hierarchical tree constructed by Calm, rather than treating it as though it were part of the larger collection e.g. PPCOO is not part of a larger PP collection.  &#x20;
* For levels beneath the collection, use letters for the section levels and numbers for the levels below that. The letters I and O should not be used for sections, as they are easily confused with the numbers 1 and 0.&#x20;
* Use a forward slash to indicate different levels within the hierarchy.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
PPCOO (collection); PPCOO/A (section); PPCOO/A/1 (series); PPCOO/A/1/1 (item)
{% endhint %}
