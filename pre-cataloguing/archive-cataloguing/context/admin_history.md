# Admin\_History\*

To provide an administrative history of, or biographical details on, the creator (or creators) of the unit of description to place the material in context and make it better understood.  &#x20;

Rules:&#x20;

* Where biographical information applies to a group of objects, include it at the highest level of the cataloguing hierarchy, rather than repeating at the granular level for each individual object. &#x20;
* Record concisely significant information on the origin, progress, development and work of the organisation (or organisations) or on the life and work of the individual (or individuals) responsible for the creation of the unit of description. If additional information is available in a published source, cite the source.&#x20;
* For persons or families record information such as full names and titles, dates of birth and death, place of birth, successive places of domicile, activities, occupation or offices, original and any other names, significant accomplishments, and place of death.&#x20;
* _If a name authority file exists for this individual or body, this historical information should be present there and can be copied across.  If a new name authority file is being created, this information should be copied to it._&#x20;
* Use paragraph tags \<p>\</p> to break up large amounts of text.&#x20;
