# Introduction

These resources are designed to support cataloguing and access to the Visual and Material Culture Collections held in Wellcome Collection. The collection, although mainly 2D graphic material, covers a broad range of formats, including prints, drawings, paintings, photographs, born digital images, sculpture and other 3D objects.

Wellcome Collection's Visual Collections are not catalogued in a single database, therefore these guidelines aim to facilitate a common approach to cataloguing, regardless of the system they are catalogued in.&#x20;

The following Cataloguing History section provides an insight into past cataloguing of the collection (pre 2021), and gives context for the legacy metadata in existing catalogue records.

The Metadata Framework identifies the common types of data the cataloguer should aim to include in a record, if known or applicable to the object being described. The Framework is based on the Cataloguing Cultural Objects (CCO) manual published by the Visual Resources Association (VRA).&#x20;

The Current System Guidelines apply the data Elements identified in the Metadata Framework to general Library (MARC/RDA) and Archive (ISAD(G)) principles, creating practical guidelines for use when cataloguing.&#x20;

A Metadata Crosswalk compares how each element of metadata is treated in MARC/RDA, ISAD(G), the Museum Accreditation standard SPECTRUM, and CCO.&#x20;
