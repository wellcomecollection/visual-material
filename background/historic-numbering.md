# Historic Numbering Systems

### Accession Numbers and Registration Numbers

Accession numbers and registration numbers can be identifiers for an item or group of items, which can be looked up on the Transcribe Wellcome database [https://wellcome.quickbase.com/db/bqg7rhzs8](https://wellcome.quickbase.com/db/bqg7rhzs8) It is important to note that visual material has been acquired historically within the remit of both the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum and Library.&#x20;

* Library accession numbers (also used for manuscripts) are numbers of up to 6 digits e.g. 43578, 329517
* Museum accession numbers always include the 'A' prefix e.g. A123456, A4598
* Museum registration numbers always include the 'R' prefix e.g. R56237, R98/1937 (n.b. the prefix 'P' is used interchangably with 'R' for some paintings)
* Museum registration numbers from the 'new' series (those which include the year of registration as well as a running number) are standardised to the following format: R + number + forward slash  \[/]  + full 4-digit year e.g. R98/1937

### Accession Number Standardisation

Accession numbers should be recorded with no gaps between prefix and the number.

### Conservation Numbers

Some material has historically been audited by colleagues in Collections Care. Some material in the audit included uncatalogued artworks, you can often find a unique number on the material that can be reconciled with a condition rating. i.e. Conservation Number: 1989/90

Material that has been audited by colleagues in collections care may also be pre-fixed with the initials of the auditor. i.e. JF1234.

### Visual Collections: some context

Before 1928, paintings were managed directly by the WHMM, whereas prints and drawings were the responsibility of the library. Separate catalogue and accession registers for prints survive from the early 1900s, with the first numbering sequence introduced in 1914. A distinction in documentation practice for paintings survived the merging of responsibility for prints, drawings, paintings and photographs into a single WHMM department in 1928: paintings destined for display continued to be entered into the museum registration systems (often distinguished from other museum objects by a 'P' prefix in the sequence rather than the usual 'R'), but unlike other museum objects do not appear to have been allocated 'A' numbers. Instead, separate accession registers and card indexes were maintained for prints, engravings, drawings, paintings and photographs, distinct from the main museum registers and card indexes. Collections of prints, drawings, paintings and photographs reverted to the responsibility of the library from 1974, although new acquisitions to these collections continued to be documented in the various specialist registers until the 1980s, and only thereafter in the main library registers.

The table below summarises the numbering systems used for paintings, prints, drawings and photographs at various dates:&#x20;
