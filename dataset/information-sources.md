### Sources of Information

The chief source of information is any text provided by the creator on or with the item being catalogued. DCRM(G)

If further information is available, beyond that provided by the creator or the item, then this should be included in the record and the source acknowledged where appropriate.

When describing material known to be imperfect (physically damaged or lacking information available on a complete example), the catalogue record should describe a perfect example, if that information is available. Cite the source used for the perfect item and include a local note on the imperfection DCRM(G) 0B2.2. Local notes in the main bibliographic record are indicated by the subfield 5, the OCLC MARC notes detail where the use of this subfield is allowed. If when using subfield 5 the final display in the catalogue appears incorrect (i.e. it displays the contents of subfield 5) then inform Library Systems – it should be possible to request the suppression of this subfield from public view.

Is the work a unique item, such as a painting, or one created as a multiple edition, like prints and posters?
