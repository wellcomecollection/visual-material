# Identifying prints

Prints themselves will often but not always, indicate the printing technique used. An engraving may be identified by the use of 'engraver' or an abbreviation of this, or by the use of 'sculp.' Lithographs too, are often referenced on the print as 'Litho' with the name or initials of the lithographer. 

In 'How to Identify Prints A complete guide to manual and mechanical processes from woodcut to injket' by Bamber Gascoigne, he notes that if you have no idea as what your print may be to ask yourself questions, and by a process of yes/no answers they will lead to the appropriate section of his book. Even, without this reference, approaching a print in this way can rule out what technique it is not.  Another useful resource is 'Prints and Printmaking An introduction to the history and techniques' by Anthony Griffiths, which has a section on abbreviations and lettering regarding technical terms which may be a support to the cataloguer.

### Other Print Collections

Other print collections can also be a useful tool in helping to identify prints in terms of their technique but also with title descriptions and subjects. Many prints that are in the Wellcome Collection have been found to also be represented in the British Museums Prints and Drawings Collections, some of whose prints have lettering, where items in our collection do not.
