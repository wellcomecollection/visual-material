## Sources of Information

### Transcribe Wellcome

Transcribe Wellcome is a project in progress to transcribe the digitised accession registers held in the collection, detailing items that formed part of the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum and Wellcome Historical Medical Library. The transcribed entries in QuickBase are a great resource for checking what provenance details are held for items on entry to the collection. Even if the entry has not been digitised for the item you are cataloguing, it will still take you to the relevant page in the digitised register where you can look up information.
