# Subjects

Definition
----------

This element contains an identification, description, or interpretation of what is depicted in and by an object.

## Content&#x20;

To help create consistent interpretation of what appropriate subjects might be, the following three areas should be considered by the cataloguer:

### What is it?

This includes the genre or general established style of the object.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Portrait

Landscape
{% endhint %}

### **What is depicted?**

This includes people, places, objects, events and animals depicted in the image.

{% hint style="info" %}

Marble Arch

Vase

United States - History - Revolution, 1775-1783

{% endhint %}

For works with no figurative or narrative content, such as abstract art, describe the visual elements of the composition.

{% hint style="info" %}
geometric patterns

spheres

### What is it about?

This includes the broader subject matter of the image including representational, allegorical, religious and symbolic themes.

## Terminology&#x20;

At Wellcome the subject element is recorded as subject terms. It may repeat terms used in the Title, Creator or Object description. An additional free text note may be added where clarification is required.

A controlled list of terms must be used to ensure consistency with terminology based on [LCSH](https://authorities.loc.gov), Getty [AAT](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat), and [MeSH](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/search).  If possible, subject terms and related information should be stored in authorities linked to the work record. In addition to topical subject terms, LCSH & AAT can be used to identify terms for personal and corporate names, and LCSH is a source of authorised terms for geographical places, and historical events.

Multiple terms can be chosen up to 10 subject terms. Where more than 10 could be selected, choose the most prominent to record.

Do not include interpretative subjects if you do not have scholarly opinion to support it, ‘it is better to be broad and accurate rather than specific and incorrect’. If scholarly opinion is divided regarding subject content, or if subject information is otherwise uncertain or ambiguous, this should be indicated as free text&#x20;
