# Technique and Materials

## Definition

These elements specify the materials used to create the object, or group of objects, and where appropriate the techniques or processes used.

Technique refers to a specific process for applying or forming a material to create an object, with terms often including object types and materials in their names.

{% hint style="info" %}
* chalk drawing&#x20;
* acrylic painting
* stone carving
* engraving
* frosting
{% endhint %}

Material refers to the elements the object is made out of including the support and the mediums used to apply colour and details.

{% hint style="info" %}
* chalk
* acrylic paint
* paper
* stone
* marble&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Terminology

To ensure consistency, terms for technique, medium and materials must be taken from the [Getty AAT](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/).&#x20;

Short lists for easy use are available below this entry in the sidebar. &#x20;

## Free Text Layout

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Single Object" %}
Each term should be expressed in a singular, non-abbreviated form but the element may be repeated if multiple techniques and/or mediums apply.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Group of Objects" %}
Terms can be expressed in plural where they apply to multiple objects and should be chosen to describe each object in the group.&#x20;

If this would result in too many different techniques or material terms, choose the most prominent and/or broadest terms.&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

When this element is expressed as free text, natural language may be used to express the relationships between techniques and materials or imply where one technique is more prominent than another. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
stipple engraving with etching on paper

gouache on wood; acrylic with pencil drawing on paper
{% endhint %}

There is also no need to repeat object types when they would also be included in the technique term. The following would both be acceptable:

{% hint style="info" %}
drawing; ink on paper&#x20;

OR

ink drawing on paper&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If there is uncertainty on the specific technique or medium, use the broadest applicable known term.

### Terms as access points

Where a system allows inclusion of technique and material terms in fixed fields, or as access points, record these as plural terms regardless of number.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
stipple engravings

etchings
{% endhint %}

If there is uncertainty on the specific technique or medium, use the broadest applicable known term.

## Colour

Where colour is intrinsic to the technique term such as in 'chromolithograph' include both the broad term 'lithograph' and the colour specific term 'chromolithograph' in the record.&#x20;

If hand-coloured or otherwise a notable characteristic of the object, see the [Colour](../colour.md) element.&#x20;

## Identification

To help with identifying techniques, mediums and materials, please see the [Identification section](../../../pre-cataloguing/about/specifics.md).&#x20;
