# Date of Creation

## Definition

The Date element records the date of creation, production or publication of the object. For unpublished works the date will refer to a date of creation. For published objects such as prints there may be a publication date and/or a copyright date.

### i. Types of Date

Only the creation date is mandatory; if not known, it can be estimated.

**Creation Date**   
Record the date the object was created or produced as standardised below.

**Publication Date**  
If applicable and known, record the date the object was published.

**Other Dates**  
Some objects can have multiple creation dates relating to different aspects of the process, or a date range to capture a period of creation. Where necessary include a note to explain the dates given to the object. Any other known dates associated with the alteration of the object should be added to a note or description field in the record.

{% hint style="info" %}
photograph taken 1898, printed 1914
{% endhint %}

Dates relating to acquisition, purchase, accession or ownership of an object should be included in the [provenance element](provenance.md). 

### ii Date Formats

For dates recorded in fixed fields in a database, enter the year or range of years. Where a range of years applies, record the Earliest and Latest dates in dedicated fields. 

For free text fields in a database, record the date to the greatest specificity known, using one of the following appropriate formats.

**Known dates**

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left"><b>Known date content</b>
      </th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Known date format</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Day, Month, Year</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">04 April 1954</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Month, Year</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">April 1954</td>

      <td style="text-align:left">Year</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">1954</td>
    </tr>

      <td style="text-align:left">19th century</td>
    </tr>

      <td style="text-align:left">

        <p>between 1860 and 1893</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Unknown, ambiguous and approximate dates**

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Unknown date content</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Unknown date format</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Estimated year</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>c.1962</p>
        <p>approximately 1962
          <br />1962?</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">2 possible dates</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">1781 or 1782</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Estimated range</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>c.1860-1872
          <br />1953-c.1960
          <br />c.1953-c.1969</p>
        <p>between 1860 and 1893</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Where the date is inscribed on an object in a differing format this should be recorded in the record within a free text date field or in a separate explanatory note. The transcribed date can be qualified by including the date in an unambiguous form within square brackets. _See Inscription element._ 

### iii. Source of Date

Where dates are taken from another source or estimated this must be made clear in the record, either within an explanatory note or by the use of square brackets. 

### iv. Dates for Groups of Objects

For **groups of objects**, ****record the range of dates for the earliest known or estimated date to the latest known or estimated date for the _**whole group**_ of objects being catalogued, not ranges of dates for each object. 

## Related Elements

Dates transcribed from the object are included in the **Inscription element**.
