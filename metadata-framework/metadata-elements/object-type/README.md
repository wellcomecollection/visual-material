# Object Type

## Definition

This identifies the specific **type of object** being catalogued. It determines how to refer to an object. 

**Object Type in the Wellcome Collection catalogue refers to** **physical form and/or function**. The medium/technique is recorded as a separate element. 

## Terminology

Object Type is recorded using controlled vocabulary to ensure consistent terminology in the catalogue.  Common terms applicable to Wellcome Collection are listed in the [**Object Type List**](object-type-list.md). When cataloguing select from this list. When a relevant term for the item being catalogued is not listed, select a suitable term from the [Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus.](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/) 

For born digital objects, use the broad term 'image file'.

The broadest **object type term or terms is** best expressed in conjunction with the **number of objects** data.

{% hint style="info" %}
**1 print** 

**3 paintings**

**14 drawings, 8 photographs and 9 paintings**
{% endhint %}

## Allocating multiple terms and specificity

Multiple terms can be chosen for the same object or group of objects, if known or applicable.

### 2D Objects
For 2D objects include a broad term to describe the object type, and where possible a more specific term. Select the broad term from the following:

*	drawing
*	painting
*	photograph
*	print

If a more specific term cannot be allocated to the object, or is not known, the broad terms listed above are sufficient. In such a situation the broad term can be repeated in the record if required by the cataloguing system.

Include all the relevant terms for the object or group of objects being described in the catalogue record to optimise access.

4 image files

1 print
