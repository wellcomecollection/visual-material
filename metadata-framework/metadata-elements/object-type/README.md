# Object Type

## Definition

This identifies the specific **type of object** being catalogued. It determines how to refer to an object. 

**Object Type in the Wellcome Collection catalogue refers to** **physical form and/or function**. The medium/technique is recorded as a separate element. 

## Terminology

Object Type must be recorded using controlled vocabulary to ensure consistency in the catalogue. The ideal is to create a list of controlled terms in existence in Wellcome data, until this is achieved the catalogue and Wellcome Genre List can be consulted for current term usage. _Note: the Genre list covers both object type and technique._ 

When a relevant term for the item being catalogued is not listed, select a suitable term from the [Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus.](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/)

## Recording broad and specific terms 
For 2D objects include one of the following broad terms (where applicable to the object being catalogued), plus a more specific term if known.
* drawing
* painting
* photograph
* print

For born digital objects, use the broad term **image file**

If the cataloguer cannot determine a specific object type term for the object, a general, broader term will be sufficient. In such a situation the broad term can be repeated in the record if required by the cataloguing system.

Multiple terms can be chosen for the same object or group of objects, if known or applicable.

Include all the relevant terms for the object or group of objects being described in the catalogue record to optimise access.

## **Related Elements**

Object type terms for 2D graphic objects may be duplicated in the **Technique** element.   
The broadest applicable Object type is recorded in association with the **Number of Objects**
