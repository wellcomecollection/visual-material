# Object Type

## Definition

This identifies the specific **type of object** being catalogued. It determines how to refer to an object. 

**Object Type in the Wellcome Collection catalogue refers to** **physical form and/or function**. The medium/technique is recorded as a separate element. 

## Terminology

Object Type is recorded using controlled vocabulary to ensure consistent terminology in the catalogue.  Common terms applicable to Wellcome Collection are listed in the [**Object Type List**](object-type-list.md). When cataloguing select from this list. When a relevant term for the item being catalogued is not listed, select a suitable term from the [Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus.](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/) 

For born digital objects, use the broad term 'image file'.

The broadest **object type term or terms is** best expressed in conjunction with the **number of objects** data.

## Allocating multiple terms and specificity

‌Include all the relevant terms for the object or group of objects being described in the catalogue record to optimise access.
