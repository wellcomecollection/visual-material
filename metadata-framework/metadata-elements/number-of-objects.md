# Number of Objects

## Definition

This element specifies the number of objects or component parts of the object being described within the catalogue record.

The number must be expressed as an Arabic numeral.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Individual Object" %}
The data for number of objects is best expressed in conjunction with the broadest **object type term.**

{% hint style="info" %}
1 print

1 painting
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Group of Objects" %}
For objects where multiple component parts are being described in a single record, the data should record the number of objects for each **object type**.

{% hint style="info" %}
3 drawings, 20 prints, 40 photographs
{% endhint %}

Where there are multiple images on or within a single physical item/single support, the data for number of objects is best expressed in conjunction with the **container** or **support** where relevant.

{% hint style="info" %}
2 drawings on 1 sheet

1 painting in 3 panels

4 photographs in 1 frame

3 drawings on 1 mount
{% endhint %}

Where there are multiple images on a single support but also multiple supports, both should be expressed.

{% hint style="info" %}
2 photographs on 1 plate, 2 photographs on 2 sheets
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

When an object being described is considered a single object, but has several component parts that make up the whole, these should be enumerated within the number of objects data.

{% hint style="info" %}
1 sculpture (in 5 parts)
{% endhint %}

Any container or housing that is catalogued with the object or group of objects, can be described in a descriptive note.

{% hint style="info" %}
mounted and framed

framed during Wellcome exhibition

in metal box acquired with object.
{% endhint %}

Additional information written on the original container, the condition and/or the physical characteristics of the container, may also be included in a descriptive or provenance note to enhance the record.

If the container is to be recorded and produced separately, a reference to it should be added in a descriptive note.

{% hint style="info" %}
Catalogue record for metal box acquired with object 540972i.
{% endhint %}
