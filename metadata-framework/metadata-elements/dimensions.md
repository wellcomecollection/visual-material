# Dimensions

## Definition

This element records the dimensions or overall size of the object or group of objects.&#x20;

## Which dimensions should be recorded

* 2D object: record height x width
* 3D object: record height x width x depth
* Circular object: record diameter
* Born digital object: record overall byte size

At minimum the largest dimensions of a single object, or a range of the smallest and largest dimensions for a group of objects, should be recorded. Records may also include measurements of more specific elements such as plate mark.

## Unit of measurement

2D and 3D Objects: Record dimensions in cm, and round to 1 decimal place.

Born Digital Objects: Record the size of the object or objects in bytes, rounding up to one decimal point to the nearest KB, GB and MB as most appropriate.

## Areas of Measurement

Specify what is being measured using the following standard terms:

* sheet&#x20;
* plate mark
* mount&#x20;
* frame&#x20;
* box
* album
* sketchbook
* scrapbook
* print
* plate
* negative&#x20;
* canvas
* panel
* folded&#x20;
* rolled

## Layout

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Single objects" %}
Multiple areas can be measured for a single object.

{% hint style="info" %}
Plate mark 20.5 x 30.5 cm, sheet 30 x 40 cm
{% endhint %}

If the shape is unusual or a distinguishing characteristic, record an indication of the outline form.

{% hint style="info" %}
Frame 45 x 20.5 cm (oval)
{% endhint %}

If the object contains multiple distinct images, record an indication of the section.

{% hint style="info" %}
Overall 183 x 187 cm; Central panel 183 x 105 cm; Each side panel 183 x 39 cm
{% endhint %}

For multiple-part objects, record the number and dimensions of the components.

{% hint style="info" %}
4 panels 60 x 110 cm; Each panel 23 x 45 cm
{% endhint %}

If the object is irregularly shaped record the greatest dimensions
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Group of objects" %}
A group of objects can be recorded in the same way as individual objects.

However if they are too numerous, or access wouldn't be significantly enhanced by describing dimensions individually, they may be expressed in a range including the greatest dimensions of the smallest and largest objects.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Frames range in size from 24 x 52 cm to 34 x 60 cm
{% endhint %}

If the group is relatively homogeneous, it may be useful to still specify other specific elements of the object being recorded in a range.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Frames range in size from 24 x 52 cm to 34 x 60 cm; sheets range in size from 14 x 32 cm to 20 x 49 cm

Album 30.5 x 55.7 cm; photographs range in size from 8.4 x 11.7 cm to 12.9 x 13.5 cm
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Born Digital" %}
Specify the dimension type and value in lowercase with spaces between.

Element of object being recorded is stated first followed by dimension then shape characteristic if relevant to interpretation of dimension.

Specify the dimension type and value in lowercase with spaces between.

Order dimensions according to natural orientation
