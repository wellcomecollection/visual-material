# Identification Number

## Definition

This element records all identifying numbers associated with the object or group of objects.

A **unique number** must be allocated to every object or group of objects to enable identification. The number must be attached to the object or it’s container.

## Current identification numbers in Wellcome Collection

Currently there is not a single sequence of identification numbers for objects in Wellcome Collection. The unique numbers follow Wellcome conventions for Visual Materials or Archives. These numbers should be recorded as the main identification number.

## Additional numbers associated with an object

The catalogue record should include all known identification numbers associated with an object or group of objects. The type of number should be recorded in addition to the number itself.
