# Edition

## **Definition**

For prints and 2D and 3D objects produced in multiples, the term edition is used to:

* place a specific object in the context of multiples of the same object issued at the same time. In this situation it would describe prints created from the same matrix (plate) or sculptures cast from the same mold.&#x20;

_or_

* to place that object in relation to previous and subsequent editions.

Edition should only be used when recording single objects, not groups.&#x20;

## Source

Edition statements may be found on the title page or within book-like works, or in inscriptions on single-sheet works.&#x20;

Secondary sources, such as catalogues raisonnés, can help to identify the edition of a work, as will comparison to other known instances of the same work. If taken from a secondary source, make this clear and cite the source.&#x20;

## Style and Language

The metadata should describe the specific edition to which the object belongs, it can be expressed as a fractional number or contextualised with a name or in relation to other objects from the same or other issues.&#x20;

* For objects issued in multiples at the same time, record the edition information as a fractional number: the impression number/edition size.
* If the impression number is unknown, record the size of the edition, if known.
* Use Arabic cardinal numbers (e.g. 5) and ordinal numbers (e.g. 3rd) as appropriate.
* Avoid abbreviations.
* Use lower case except when a term includes a proper name.
* If there is an edition statement on the work, transcribe it in the original language.
