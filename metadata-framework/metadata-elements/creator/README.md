# Creator

## Definition

The Creator element should capture the name(s) of those responsible for the design and making of an object, and their role in that process. The metadata should record all identified creators.

Creators can be individuals, groups of individuals, corporate bodies or other entities involved in the creation of an object.

For published works, particularly prints, record the publisher as a creator, if known.

## Identifying creators

The names of creators should be taken from the object itself or accompanying documentation from acquisition, previous cataloguing or provenance records. Where the creator name is taken from another source ensure that information is noted in the record and include a reference to the source.

### i. Uncertain attribution

If attribution is uncertain or contested, record the attributed name(s) in the creator field and clarify the attribution with a qualifying term in a note. Where the name of the attributed creator is known use one of the following terms:

{% hint style="info" %}
attributed to

formerly attributed to

probably by

possibly by
{% endhint %}

If opinion on attribution is divided, then record this information in the record and index all the names in question.

{% hint style="info" %}
possibly by Denis Gascoigne Lillie or T. Jeffery Parker.
{% endhint %}

### ii. Unknown creators

Where a creator is not known the creator element can be omitted. If the geographical origin is known this can be used in the description to provide background to an unknown creator, e.g. Italian.

#### Unknown creators linked to a known creator

Where the creator is unknown but they are known to have worked closely with a known creator or have been influenced by their work, include the known name and use a qualifying term to explain the association.

{% hint style="info" %}
studio of

pupil of

follower of

style of

after
{% endhint %}

### iii. Works after the work of another creator

Where an object is considered to be based on a work by another creator, include a note in the catalogue record recognising this fact, using the qualifying term **after**.

{% endhint %}

### iv. Common terminology found on prints

The names of creators and their relationship to an object will often be present on a print, generally written in Latin. The name of the original artist is traditionally on the left of the image, the details of the printmaker is found on the right. Commonly found terms include:

| Pinx. / Pinxit / Ping.             |  = painted by  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Del. / Delt. / Delin. / Delineavit |  = drawn by    |
| Inv. / Invenit                     | = designed by  |
| Des. / Desig.                      | = designer     |
| F. / Fec. / Fac. / Fecit           | = made by      |
| Sc. / Sculp. / Sculpsit            | = engraved by  |
| Exc. / Excudit                     | = published by |
| Imp. / Impressit                   | = printed by   |
| Lithog.                            | = lithographer |

## Name **source and format**

The format and spelling for creator names should be taken from an authority list to ensure consistency. Check for an entry in the **Wellcome Collection catalogue** and use this if present. If multiple versions are present, prefer the LC/ULAN source, or local version closest to the guidance below.&#x20;

If the name is new to the Wellcome catalogue, check: [**Library of Congress authorities**](https://authorities.loc.gov) **(LC)**, [**Getty Union List of Artists Names**](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/) **(ULAN)** or other reliable sources. When using an existing entry in the Wellcome Catalogue, LC or ULAN authority lists, enter the name exactly as written in the authoritative source. Relator terms (see below) can be added as an addition to authority name entries.

### **i. Personal names**

If there is more than one version of the name in use, select the most commonly used.

When creating an entry for names not found in authority lists, structure personal names as follows, include the known or relevant elements:

Surname, First name(s), Title, dates of existence

{% hint style="info" %}
Lichtenstein, Roy, 1923-1997

Thompson, J, 1837-1921

Hogarth, William, 1697-1764

Shrigley, David

Wren, Christopher, Sir, 1632-1723

Health Education Council, 1968-2000

The Adamson Collection Trust
{% endhint %}

When an artist is recognised by a single name, prefer the known name over Surname, First name structure.

{% hint style="info" %}
Raphael, 1493-1520

Cassils
{% endhint %}

If the individual has a longer name they are not commonly known by this may be included after the first name in brackets.

{% hint style="info" %}
Bishop, Mary (Mary Cecil Hamilton), 1914-1990
{% endhint %}

### **ii. Corporate names**

If no authority can be found, take the name as it is written on the object or accompanying documentation. Where there is more than one version of the name in use prefer the version found in the LC or ULAN authority lists.

{% hint style="info" %}
Wellcome Collection
{% endhint %}

### iii. Dates

For personal names include dates if known. When using names taken from the LC authority file use the same dates as recorded in the authority record.

Where the birth and death dates are not known, include the full range of dates for the artworks you are aware of, as an approximate active date.

{% hint style="info" %}
Bell, Stuart, active 1966-68
{% endhint %}

### iv. Role of creator

In addition to the creator name, record the relationship of that person/entity to the object, i.e. their role in its creation. To ensure consistency, terminology should be taken from the Wellcome [**Relator Terms list**](relator-terms.md). If no appropriate terms are listed use another concise term to indicate the nature of the relationship.

## Multiple creators

If multiple entities were involved in creating the object or group of objects, record all of them in the manner above. If they are too numerous, record the most important or most prominent. This includes both individuals and organisations involved in the commission, production, copying, alteration and/or publication.

## Biographical details

Include biographical information on the creator when such information is not common knowledge and where the objects are unique or significant to Wellcome Collection.

Where biographical information applies to a group of objects, include it at the highest level of the cataloguing hierarchy (if applicable), rather than repeating at the granular level for each individual object.
