# Title/Brief Description

## Definition

The title or name given to an object, or a brief description of the object. This element is essential, even when an object has no given title and can only be given a brief description. It offers a name by which to refer to the object and aids identification. 

## Types of Title 

### Preferred and Alternative Titles

All titles by which an object is known should be included in the catalogue record, but a preferred \(main title\) must be identified. All other titles should be recorded as alternative titles.

* Where an object has a Given title, use this as the preferred title.
* Where an object has an Inscribed title and no Given title, use this as the preferred title. 
* Where an object does not have a Given or Inscribed title, the cataloguer should devise a brief description to use as the Descriptive title. 
* Where the preferred title is a Given title or Inscribed title, ensure a brief description of the object is also included in the record.

### Given Title

This is a title for an object, or a collective title for a group of objects, assigned by the creator or another authoritative source.

{% hint style="info" %}
Nail schizophrene.  [3049675i](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/azc3hheb)

Time lapse. [3136753i](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/ftqy78zj)
{% endhint %}

### Inscribed Title

This is a title taken from an inscription, text or caption on the object or group of objects.

{% hint style="info" %}
No smoking no hate.  [3197871i](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/trkdjmg3)
{% endhint %}

If an inscribed title taken from the object has notable features, such as being written in mirror writing, or is incorporated into the visual design, a note recording this feature can be added to the record. 

### Descriptive Title

With a descriptive title, a brief description of the object or group of objects is provided, which can be used for identification purposes. The cataloguer should aim to be concise, making clear to the reader what the what the work is or what its subject is about.

Avoid interpretations, or inferring emotions, themes or allegories without a source. Look for literal representations, if there are no literal representations look for shapes and colour.

For 2D and Born Digital graphic objects this should be a short description of the subject matter of the item. Include, as appropriate, the following types of information:

* the subject type or form of material, e.g., view\(s\), portrait\(s\), sketch\(es\)
* an identification of the main subject\(s\) depicted \(i.e., names of persons, events, activities, and objects\)
* geographical location\(s\) depicted, if known and significant
* the date of what is being depicted if different from the date of publication or execution

For 3D objects use a suitable term or phrase to describe the object.

{% endhint %}

## Language of Title

If an object has a non English title, record the title in it's original language, and original script if that is supported. Record it as the main title. If a translation and/or a transliteration are also present, include these as alternative titles. 

## Title Source

Record the source of the preferred \(main\) title used in the catalogue record. Record if the title was provided by the creator, has been taken from the object itself, from previous owners, from supporting documentation, or whether the title is a brief description of the work created by the cataloguer. Where possible select the appropriate text from the list below:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Single Object" %}
* Title provided by the artist.
* Title provided by the creator.
* The title has been taken from wording on the object. 
* This work is untitled: the title has been supplied by the cataloguer for identification purposes.
* This work is untitled: the title has been taken from acquisition documentation.
* Title taken from published source: \[example: Catalogue of prints & drawings in the British Museum\].
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Group of Objects" %}
* Title provided by the artist.
* Title provided by the creator.
* These works are untitled: the title has been taken from lettering on the objects. 
* These works are untitled: the title has been supplied by the cataloguer for identification purposes.
* These works are untitled: the title has been taken from acquisition documentation.
* Title taken from published source: \[example: Catalogue of prints & drawings in the British Museum\].
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Born Digital Objects" %}
* Title provided by the artist.
* Title provided by the creator.
* To enhance accessibility, the title has been supplied by the cataloguer. 
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Amending the Preferred Title

If a new title needs to be given where an existing descriptive title is incorrect, insufficient or offensive, retain the existing title as an alternative title in the following layout:

Previous title, replaced DATE \(Month Year\): Text of previous title

{% hint style="info" %}
Previous title, replaced November 2019: The face of a beautiful woman is revealed as a mask covering her real face, which is hideously disfigured with syphilitic sores. Colour lithograph after Forsyth, ca. 1946\(?\)
{% endhint %}

## The use of Untitled as a title

When a creator assigns Untitled as the title of an object, this should be used as the preferred title in the record.

Untitled should not be used as a title when an object has no given title.

{% hint style="info" %}
Untitled. [3272401i](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/rnsgfs2m)
{% endhint %}
