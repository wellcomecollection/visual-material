# Inscription / Marks

## Definition

The inscription element offers a transcription (and where necessary a description) of any distinguishing or identifying physical lettering, annotations, texts, markings, or labels that are affixed, applied, stamped, printed, written, inscribed, or attached to the work. It excludes any mark or text inherent in the materials of which the work is made e.g. watermarks.

## Capturing an inscription

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Single Object" %}
Transcribe the inscription exactly as it appears on the object, replicating the spelling, diacritics, case and abbreviations used in the inscription. Indicate line breaks with a forward slash.

Follow each discrete part of the inscription with an explanation of the inscription type and location on the object.

{% hint style="info" %}
Etched by George Cruikshank (signature, printed, bottom left recto)

Artificial Pigeon Shooting, at the Stadium, Chelsea (printed, bottom centre recto)

Publish'd according to Act of Parliament Feb 1 1750 (printed, bottom centre left recto)

Design'd by W. Hogarth (printed, bottom left recto)&#x20;

Pinewood. Parks, Margaret. 9.1.67 (the name of the artist, the house at the hospital, the date of the work are written on the verso by Edward Adamson)
{% endhint %}

Where the object has been signed by hand record this information.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Signed in pencil (bottom right recto)

Bears number '216' (in ink top right)
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Group of Objects" %}
For groups of objects capturing inscriptions is not mandatory. Consider any text on the objects that may be useful as contextual information for the group as a whole, and transcribe if that information is not clear elsewhere in the record.&#x20;
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Exhaustivity

Whether the record captures the inscriptions in totality is at the cataloguers discretion. Record important information in the inscription in the appropriate elements elsewhere in the record: names, dates, title, subject.&#x20;

If an inscription is too long to transcribe, transcribe part of it and indicate missing text with an ellipsis.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Doecker hospital huts recently purchased for the accommodation of the wounded sent home from South Africa ... from a photograph by Stephen Cribb, Southsea
{% endhint %}

## Inscribed dates

Where the date is inscribed on an object in a differing format to how it is recorded elsewhere in the catalogue record, transcribe as it is written, in a free text date field or in a separate explanatory note. The transcribed date can be qualified by including the date in an unambiguous form within square brackets.

{% hint style="info" %}
May 14 '53 \[14 May 1953]

7.9.71 \[7 September 1971]
{% endhint %}

## Ambiguity and uncertainty

For any words or characters that are not clear, include these within square brackets to indicate uncertainty.

{% hint style="info" %}
A map of the ear. Magnified to four times its natural size ; G. \[Kirtland?] delint. 1801, from a preparation of Mr. A\[st]ley Cooper's
{% endhint %}

## Capturing stamps and ownership marks

Where a stamp or mark can be transcribed, include a transcription, followed by a brief explanation of the mark type.

If the mark can not easily be transcribed, include a brief description of the mark.

If the mark can be attributed to a particular person or identifiable body then include this information.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
