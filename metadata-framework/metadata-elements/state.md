# State

## Definition

The term state is used to describe identical impressions printed from the same unchanged printing plate, block or stone (matrix). It identifies the relationship of an object created in multiples to other stages of the same object.

While state generally refers to prints, some of the same terminology is applied to sculptures, in reference to their state, such as artists proof.

This element contains any known information related to an objects state.

State should only be used when recording single objects, not groups.&#x20;

## Types of state and terminology

### Numbered and named states

State is often expressed by a number indicating the place of the state in relation to other known states. This is generally noted in conjunction with the name of the person who identified the known states and the date they published their research.&#x20;

Unnumbered states generally date from the time before a print was completed or in circulation. identified by specific terms

**Artist's proof** or _epreuve d'artiste_ is used for impressions printed especially for the artist and excluded from the numbering of an edition. It maybe found on the print abbreviated as **AP** or **EA**, and numbered with an edition number according to the number of artist's proofs pulled (e.g., AP 2/12).\
\
**Bon à tirer** or _right to print_ is used for the proof approved by the artist to establish the standard for all of the other prints in the edition.

**Hors commerce** meaning **** _outside the commercial edition_ is used for proofs that were excluded from the numbering of an edition, and were not intended for sale, not artist's proofs, or bon à tirer. It maybe abbreviated as **HC** on the print.

**Printer's proof** is used for impressions printed as tests for the printer and excluded from the numbering of an edition. It maybe found ion the print, abbreviated **PP**.

The terms below are commonly used to describe unnumbered states.&#x20;
